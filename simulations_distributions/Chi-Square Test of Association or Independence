#Chi-Square Association or Independence Test Problem & Example Solution in Python
#In the StudentSurvey dataset, students chose which of the 3 awards they would prefer to 
#win: Olympic medal, Nobel Prize, or Academy Award. The dataset also includes a column HigherSAT
#indicating the part of the SAT in which the student made a higher score. Using exactly that column of 
#values, test the claim that there is an association between the type of award a student prefers and 
#their value in that HigherSat data column. Use a theoretical distâ€™n and Locke dataset 3rd ed.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency #new / haven't used before other inference tests

# Step 1: Create the observed data table as it is created in Statkey with exact order specified for categories
data = np.array([[116, 61],  # Olympic
                 [68, 79],   # Nobel
                 [21, 10]])  # Academy

# Step 2: Perform the Chi-Square test using dataset in problem with built array following exact formula
chi2_stat, p_value, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(data)

# Step 3: Display the results
print("Chi-Square Statistic:", chi2_stat)
print("P-Value:", p_value)
print("Degrees of Freedom:", dof)
print("Expected Counts:")
print(expected)

# Step 4: Interpretation of p-value results obtained
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: There is an association between award preference and SAT section.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: There is no significant association between award preference and SAT section.")
