#Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test Problem & Example Solution in Python
#Problem Given: " In the StudentSurvey dataset, students chose which of the 3 awards they would prefer to 
#win: Olympic medal, Nobel Prize, or Academy Award. Test the claim that 9% of the students in the 
#population this represents prefer the Academy Award and the remaining students are evenly split 
#between the other two awards. Use a theoretical distribution. "

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Observed values (data collected from the sample) -
observed = np.array([31, 149, 182])

# Expected values based on the hypothesis
total_students = 362  # total from example problem dataset public Locke stats book 
expected = np.array([0.09 * total_students, 0.455 * total_students, 0.455 * total_students])

# Perform the Chi-Square test
chi2_stat, p_value = stats.chisquare(observed, expected)

# Print the results
print(f"Chi-Square Statistic: {chi2_stat}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}") #note this setup gives same statistic (chi-square value) + p value as statkey (theoretic dist not randomization way)

# Interpret the result
alpha = 0.05  # significance level (not given in problem so assumed)
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis (there is enough evidence to support the claim).")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis (there is not enough evidence to support the claim).")
